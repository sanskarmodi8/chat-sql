# ðŸ¦œ Chat with SQL Database

This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database through a conversational interface powered by the ChatGroq language model. It utilizes LangChain tools to create an SQL agent capable of running queries and retrieving data based on user input.
